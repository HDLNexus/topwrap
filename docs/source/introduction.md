# Introduction to Topwrap

Topwrap takes advantage of modularity by enabling the reuse of blocks across designs and facilitates the shift towards automation in logic design. It provides a standardized way of aggregating blocks in various configurations and makes top-level designs easy to parse as well as providing a method of processing them automatically. 

As a tool, Topwrap makes it [easy to build](https://antmicro.github.io/topwrap/getting_started.html) complex and [synthesizable designs](https://antmicro.github.io/topwrap/examples.html) with the help of the [design file](https://antmicro.github.io/topwrap/description_files.html), while the mix of a [GUI and CLI-based](https://antmicro.github.io/topwrap/usage.html) configuration allows for a limitless amount of fine tuning possibilities. These designs can be quickly shared at the click of a button. [Packaging multiple files](https://antmicro.github.io/topwrap/user_repositories.html) is also as simple as including them in a custom user repository, while an internal API allows for constructing repositories using Python.  

Topwrap uses [FuseSoC](https://antmicro.github.io/topwrap/fusesoc.html) to automate project generation and build processes.
