# Setup

It is recommended for developers to keep code style and frequently run tests.
In order to setup the developer's environment install python packages from `requirements.dev.txt`, which shall include `nox` and `pre-commit`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```
