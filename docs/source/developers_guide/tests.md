# Tests

Topwrap functionality is validated with tests, leveraging the `pytest` library.


## Test execution

Tests are located in the `tests` directory.
All tests can be run with `nox` by specifying the tests session:

```bash
nox -s tests
```

Tests can also be launched without `nox` by executing:
```bash
pytest
```
