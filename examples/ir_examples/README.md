# Examples for internal representation

These examples represent different feature sets that are important for us in Topwrap.
They are used to gather requirements for our internal data format based on features we want to support and on the syntax of other independent external formats like IP-XACT.

More information about them is available in the documentation at https://antmicro.github.io/topwrap/developers_guide/ir-examples.md
